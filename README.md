# Power-Bi-Assignment-Questions-Solutions

📊 Power BI Assignment – Data Analysis & Visualization
This Power BI project involves data analysis, modeling, and visualization using multiple datasets, including Superstore Dataset, Finance Dataset, and Box Office Data. The project showcases advanced DAX calculations, Power Query transformations, and interactive dashboards to enhance data-driven decision-making.

📌 Key Objectives:
✔ Understand Power BI platforms and their applications.
✔ Implement DAX calculations for Year-over-Year (YoY) sales growth analysis.
✔ Perform data modeling by integrating three years of box office data.
✔ Create interactive visualizations, such as:

Waterfall Charts (Category-wise yearly analysis)

Line & Clustered Column Charts (Sales growth comparison)

Hierarchical Views (Country → State → Region → City → Postal Code)

Donut Charts with Drill-through (Region-wise profit analysis) ✔ Apply Conditional Formatting to highlight key financial metrics.
✔ Design an Interactive Finance Dashboard with navigation, slicers, and KPI indicators.
